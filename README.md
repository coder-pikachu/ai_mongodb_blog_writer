Hello, fellow tech enthusiast! Welcome to our latest and greatest endeavor: **Creating AI Agents to Research and Write a Blog with Crew AI for the Latest and Greatest in MongoDB**. Buckle up, because we're about to dive deep into the world of AI, MongoDB, and blog writing. 🎢

## 📚 Project Overview

In this project, we're harnessing the power of AI to research and generate insightful blog posts about MongoDB. We're using a cocktail of cutting-edge technologies including Crew AI and Streamlit to make this happen. 🍹✨

## 🔧 Tech Stack

Here's a peek under the hood at the technologies powering our project:

- **Python 3.10.16** 🐍
- **CrewAI 0.28.8** 🚀
- **CrewAI Tools 0.1.6** 🛠️
- **LangChain Community 0.0.29** 🔗
- **Streamlit 1.41.0** 🌐

## 🛠️ Installation

Getting started is a breeze! Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coder-pikachu/ai_mongodb_blog_writer.git
    cd ai_mongodb_blog_writer
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29 streamlit==1.41.0

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the AI agents and watch them craft blog posts before your very eyes! 🎉

## 🤖 How It Works

- **Research Agents**: Our agents scour the web for the latest and greatest in MongoDB news.
- **Writing Agents**: They then synthesize this information into a well-structured and engaging blog post.
- **Streamlit UI**: Provides an interactive interface for users to run the agents and view their progress in real-time.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Progress**: Track the agents' progress as they work their magic.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly UI built with Streamlit.
- **Cutting-edge AI**: Leverage the power of Crew AI and LangChain Community for top-notch research and writing.
